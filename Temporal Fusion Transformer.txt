The code is directly taken from pytorch forecasting website.
Here Temporal Fusion Transformer is being used for forecasting.

Why TFT?
1)Interpretability. Can point which variables significantly affects the output.
2)Capable of multihorizon forecasting.
3)Takes in to consideration, Covraites. Earlier methods were based on Autoregression.
4)Has gating networks to filter out irrelevant factors.
5)Will consider long term dependencies.
6)Will take in to account temporal patterns. These are patterns in a data window snapshot that
  shape the time series.


Pytorch forecasting is very handy.
Pytorch timeseries dataset considers all the inputs that are necessary to feed it to the network.
